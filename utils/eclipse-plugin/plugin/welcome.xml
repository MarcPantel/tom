<intro>Tom is a pattern matching compiler, developed at Inria, is particularly 
well-suited for programming various transformations on trees/terms.
Its design follows our research on rule based languages, and our experiences on
the efficient compilation of ELAN developed by the Protheo group.
The tool can be seen as a Yacc-like compiler translating patterns into 
executable pattern matching automata. Similarly to Yacc, when a match is found, 
the corresponding semantic action is triggered and executed.</intro>
