The kit is created using Inno Setup (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)

To create a new install kit for TOM, just open the script file "tomInstallScript.iss" 
with Inno IDE, modify it for the new version (the first 3 lines of the script give more 
explanations) and click on the compile button. This will generate the new ".exe" file 
for instaling TOM.
