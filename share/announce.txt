Tom 2.1 release candidate announcement
--------------------------------------

It is my great privilege and pleasure to announce the availability of
Tom version 2.1-rc2.

This release continues our work on the integration of pattern matching
and rule based programming facilities into C and Java.

Tom is a pattern matching compiler developed at INRIA. It is
particularly  well-suited for programming various transformations on
trees/terms and XML based documents. Its design follows  our research
on the efficient compilation of rule based languages (e.g. ELAN,
developed at INRIA-Loria).

Tom is a tool implemented in Tom itself. It can be seen as a Yacc-like
compiler translating patterns into executable pattern matching
automata. Similarly to Yacc, when a match is found, the corresponding
semantic action (a sequence of instructions written in C or Java) is
triggered and executed.    
Looking from another point of view, Tom is a complex compiler which adds
powerful constructs to C and Java: non linear syntactic matching,
associative matching with neutral element (a.k.a. list-matching), XML
based pattern matching, string matching, and equational rewriting.  
This offers the possibility to analyze and transform any kind of
data-structure. Tom can be used for large scale developments and
applications. It comes with documentation, programming, and debugging
support. 

This new release contains many improvements and new features:

  - a re-designed plugin based architecture
  - a new parser based on ANTLR
  - a library for defining traversal strategies
  - a new library organization
  - several bugs fixed
  
Tom is available, in open source (GPL/BSD License), from the Tom web page:
