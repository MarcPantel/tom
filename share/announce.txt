TOM 1.4 release announcement
----------------------------

It is my great privilege and pleasure to announce the availability of
jtom-1.4.

This release continues our work on the integration of pattern matching
and rule based programming facilities into C and Java.

TOM is a pattern matching compiler which is particularly well-suited
for programming various transformations on trees/terms.  
Its design follows our experiences on the efficient compilation of
rule-based systems. The tool can be seen as a Yacc-like compiler
translating patterns into executable pattern matching automata.
Similarly to Yacc, when a match is found, the corresponding semantic
action (a sequence of instructions written in C or Java) is triggered
and executed.    

This new release contains many improved and new features:

     - an Eclipse plugin
     - an interactive debugger
     - a generalized backquote construct (for building terms)
     - an extension for XML transformations

TOM is available, in open source, from the TOM web page:
