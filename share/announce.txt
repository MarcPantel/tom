Tom 2.5 announcement
--------------------

It is our great privilege and pleasure to announce the availability of
Tom version 2.5.

This release continues our work on the integration of pattern matching
and rule based programming facilities into C and Java.

Tom is a pattern matching compiler developed at INRIA. It is
particularly well-suited for programming various transformations on
trees/terms and XML based documents. Its design follows our research on
the efficient compilation of rule based languages (e.g. ELAN, developed
at INRIA-Loria).

Many applications have been developed in Tom. Among them, let us mention:
 - the Tom compiler itself
 - languages semantics, interpreters and program transformation tools
 - a Just In Time strategy compiler using dynamic Java bytecode
   transformation
 - a generator of canonical abstract syntax trees (Gom)
 - a proof assistant for supernatural deduction
 - a compiler algorithm for anti-pattern matching and disunification

Tom is a complex compiler which adds powerful constructs to C and Java:
non linear syntactic matching, associative matching with neutral element
(a.k.a. list-matching), XML based pattern matching, string matching, and
equational rewriting.
This offers the possibility to analyze and transform any kind of
data-structure. Tom can be used for large scale developments and
applications. It comes with documentation, programming, and debugging
support.

This new release contains many improvements and new features:

  - A new Compiler based on constraint solving:

  - A new strategy library:

  _ New Gom hooks:

    - Rule sets:
      It is now possible to specify an invariant in Gom by a set of
      conditional rewrite rules. This replaces the deprecated %rule
      construct, and is safer with respect to strategies.
    
    - List theory hooks 

    - hooks to alter the generated API
  
  - Gom extension for terms with pointers and term-graphs (?)

  - Associative matching with neutral element   

Tom is available, in open source (GPL/BSD License), from the web page:
