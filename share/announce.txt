TOM 2.0 release announcement
----------------------------

It is my great privilege and pleasure to announce the availability of
jtom-2.0.

This release continues our work on the integration of pattern matching
and rule based programming facilities into C and Java.

TOM is a pattern matching compiler which is particularly well-suited
for programming various transformations on trees/terms or XML documents.  

Its design follows our experiences on the efficient compilation of
rule-based systems. The tool can be seen as a Yacc-like compiler
translating patterns into executable pattern matching automata.
Similarly to Yacc, when a match is found, the corresponding semantic
action (a sequence of instructions written in C or Java) is triggered
and executed.    

This new release contains many improved and new features:

		 - support for Caml
		 - several predefined mappings
		 - an optimizer which performs inlining and improves the
		   efficiency of list-matching 
		 - support for builtin char and builtin string (seen as list of
		   char) 
     - a better XML support (backquote notation, anonymous nodes)
		 - a re-designed kernel compiler (with better algorithms)
		 - introduction of constraint to compile non-linear patterns (in a
		   more efficient way) 
		 - several bugs fixed

TOM is available, in open source, from the TOM web page:
