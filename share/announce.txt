TOM 1.5 release announcement
----------------------------

It is my great privilege and pleasure to announce the availability of
jtom-1.5.

This release continues our work on the integration of pattern matching
and rule based programming facilities into C and Java.

TOM is a pattern matching compiler which is particularly well-suited
for programming various transformations on trees/terms.  
Its design follows our experiences on the efficient compilation of
rule-based systems. The tool can be seen as a Yacc-like compiler
translating patterns into executable pattern matching automata.
Similarly to Yacc, when a match is found, the corresponding semantic
action (a sequence of instructions written in C or Java) is triggered
and executed.    

This new release contains many improved and new features:

     - an Eclipse plugin (compatible with 2.1.2 and 3.0M5)
     - an extension for XML transformations
     - a better matching algorithm
     - an extended pattern syntax
       (unamed operators, anonymous list variables, implicit notation)  


TOM is available, in open source, from the TOM web page:
