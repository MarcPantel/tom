Installing TOM

The binary distribution of Tom consists of the following directory layout:

  tom
   +--- bin (BSD Licence)
   |
   +--- lib 
   |     +--- runtime (BSD Licence)
   |     |     +--- shared-objects     // Factory of shared objects

   |     |     +--- sl                 // Strategy library
   |     |     +--- tom-library        // support for bytecode, viewer, and xml 
   |     |     +--- Bytecode           // ADT for ASM

   |     |     +--- PlatformOption     // platform options
   |     |
   |     +--- tools (not needed by the runtime, unless you use bytecode, term viewer, or xml supports)
   |     |     +--- ant                // to compile the project
   |     |     +--- antlr-2.7.7        // to compile the Tom parser
   |     |     +--- antlr-3.0          // to compile the Gom parser

   |     |     +--- junit              // to test the system
   |     |     +--- stringtemplate-3.0 // need by antlr
   |     |     +--- xercesImpl         // for XML
   |     |     +--- xml-apis           // for XML

 Only the bin/ and lib/ directories are required to run Tom.
 To install Tom, choose a directory and copy the distribution file there. 
 This directory will be known as TOM_HOME.

Setup
=====
Before you can run Tom there is some additional set up you will need
to do:
  - Add the bin directory to your path.
  - Set the TOM_HOME environment variable to the directory where you
    installed Tom.
  - JDK 1.5 or newer is needed.
    Optionally, set the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
    This should be set to the directory where your JDK is installed.

Windows
-------
We assume that Tom is installed in c:\tom\. The following steps are needed 
for setting up the environment:
  - set environment variable TOM_HOME=c:\tom
  - add %TOM_HOME%\bin to the PATH

For a detailed description of setting environment variables in Windows, 
please refer to Windows documentation. For Windows XP, some information 
can be found here :

Unix
----
Assume Tom is installed in /usr/local/tom. The following sets up the
environment:

(bash)
  export TOM_HOME=/usr/local/tom
  export PATH=${PATH}:${TOM_HOME}/bin

(csh)
  setenv TOM_HOME /usr/local/tom
  set path=( $path $TOM_HOME/bin )

We also suggest you to define a TOM_LIB variable and update your CLASSPATH:

(bash)
  TOM_LIB=`echo ${TOM_HOME}/lib/runtime/*.jar | tr ' ' ':'`
  export CLASSPATH=${TOM_LIB}:${CLASSPATH}

(csh)
  set TOM_LIB=`echo ${TOM_HOME}/lib/runtime/*.jar | tr ' ' ':'`
  setenv CLASSPATH $TOM_LIB:$CLASSPATH
