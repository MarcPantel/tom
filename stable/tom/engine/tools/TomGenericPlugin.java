/**
 * TomGenericPlugin is an abstract class which provides some code to
 * develop plugins faster. The methods implemented here can be used as such
 * most of the time as they provide a default behaviour shared by most plugins.
 * If this behaviour is not the one that is expected though, they should be
 * overridden. Just remember : extending this class is by no means necessary
 * for a plugin, the only constraint is to implement the Plugin interface.
