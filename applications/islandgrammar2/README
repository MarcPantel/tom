tests usage :

tests compare parsed tree to reference trees. Tests passes if produced tree is equals to reference tree.

(in [...]/islandgrammar2)
java -cp build:$CLASSPATH tester.Tester <folder or file to test>


to 'init' tests (make the tree produced by current parser the new reference)pass -init argument to Tester.

(in [...]/islandgrammar2)
java -cp build:$CLASSPATH tester.Tester -init <folder or file to test>


to produce graphical representation of produced trees pass -draw argument to Tester. Images will be saved in _imgs folder. This is really slow, so use it wisely.

java -cp build:$CLASSPATH tester.Tester -draw <folder or file to test>


tests files :

when working with a folder, Tester search recursively for every file and test it. Files and folders whose names starts with '_' are ignored.

For now Tester can parse a whole Java+Tom programm or Tom's Pattern alone. Java-Tom is default parser so a file with no header is considered a Java+Tom file.

Test files can include a header to add a description used to make nice-looking test outputs and to specify which parser to use 
---
if file contains a header, everything before it is just ignored.

#description "here a description of the test"
