Tests :

test-material contains some input files (*.input) and files containing what CommonTree.toStringTree() should output if parsing is succesful (*.result). This is not a really efficient test because there is a lot of equivalent trees for a given input. It is still useful anyway, because as long as tests pass, we can be sure that previously implemented feature's behaviour have not been changed while implementing new features.

to use it :
build with ant then lauch java test/Test in build.
