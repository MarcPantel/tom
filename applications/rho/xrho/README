This is an experimental implementation of an explicit version of the
rho-calculus. It is under development and is definitevely not stable
nor deliverable.

Here are some remarks:
	- syntax error implies exception and are not catch by our program (and thus we provide no guarantee).

Here are some conventions:
	- small letters denotes constants 
	- capital letters denotes variables
	- the priorities of the operator follows those of CKF05 (journal version HOSC)


Some goodies
		- you can use macro definitions. but you are not use redefinition
(this is well-known that otherwise you allow to "program" with this
feature, something we do not want)
