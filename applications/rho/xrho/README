This is an experimental implementation of an explicit version of the
rho-calculus. It is under development and is definitevely not stable
nor deliverable.

Here are some remarks:
	- 

Here are some conventions:
	- small letters denotes constants 
	- capital letters denotes variables
	- the priorities of the operator follows those of CKF05 (journal version HOSC).

Some goodies
	- you can switch from two modes (get the result) or get the full
detail of the computation in xrho. In the first case, type "$;" in the
second "$$;"
	- you can use macro definitions. but you are not use redefinition
(this is well-known that otherwise you allow to "program" with this
feature, something we do not want)
