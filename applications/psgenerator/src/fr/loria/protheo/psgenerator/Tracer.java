/**
 *  The Tracer class, is a helper for tracing method calls while assertions
 *  are enabled. <br> 
 * 
 *  For activating tracing use the java interpreter -ea flag or some of its 
 *  variations. <br>
 *  
 *  For using it just add the following line of code where you want to register
 *  a trace: <br>
 *       <CENTER><code>assert(Tracer.trace());</code></CENTER><br>
 *  Or<br>
 *       <CENTER><code>assert(Tracer.trace(someData));</code></CENTER><br>
 *  <br>
 * 
 *  And you have also somewhere to specify the output stream, as for example:<br>
 *       <CENTER><code>assert(Tracer.setTraceStream(new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream("psgen.trace"))));</code></CENTER><br>
 *  Or<br>
 *       <CENTER><code>assert(Tracer.setTraceStream(System.err));</code></CENTER><br>
