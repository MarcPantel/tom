Test.t
- Simple example, OK 

TestMept.t :
- do not works (not finished)
- done in TestMeptOK.t

TestMeptOK.t :
= TestMept.t with pre-treatment as follow

- uses a string generated by sglr (query.asfix)
- replace : '-' by '_' and 'sort' by 'my_sort'
- create an ATerm with this string
- substitute problematic elements in this ATerm :
    char_class([x, ..., ...])-> char_class([character(x), ..., ...])
    amb([..., x, ...]) -> amb([..., my_char(x), ...])
    appl(Production,[...,x , ...]) -> appl(Production,[..., my_char(x), ...])

- it is useful to understand operation needed before .asfix can be used by GOM
- uses a recursive algorithm, need to be optimized and more clearly written
