gen_sloccount.sh is a simple script which calls sloccount to count source lines
of code of the Tom project. In the current version, this script only counts
lines in src/tom, examples and test directories. Nevertheless, it can be easily
extended by adding derectory names in the $DIRS variable.

To imake this script properly work:

1. install sloccount

2. create tom_count and gom_count executables and put it with other counters.
   They can be copied from java_count or other generic counters.

3. add the following lines in your break_filelist file (can be usually found in
   /usr/libexec/sloccount/)

   "gom" => "gom",
   "t" => "tom" ,"tom" => "tom",

This should be sufficient.
