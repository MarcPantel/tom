# compile the program
$ tom.src --verify Match.t

# verify the patterns, and build a proof
$ zvtov Match.zv

# check the proof
$ coqc Match.v

# a move verbose check can be "coqtop < Match.v"

# to be able to verify the proof, make sure coq can use zenon library
# in ~/.coqrc, you have to place:
Add Rec LoadPath "<zenon_prefix>/lib/foc".
