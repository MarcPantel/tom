Getting TOM
===========

Installing TOM
==============

The sourse distribution of Tom consists of the following directory layout:

  jtom
   +--- stable   // contains the stable version 
   |
   +--- src      // contains the development branch
   |
   +--- examples // contains examples of tom use
   |
   +--- test     // the test set (used by junit)

Prepare for the build
---------------------
	The Tom build process uses ant (http://ant.apache.org). This build process is
	specified by the build.xml file. You will need to install apache ant and java
	1.4 in order to compile Tom.
	Next step is to copy the local.properties_template file, found at the root of
	jtom to local.properties, and edit it to reflect your setup:
		tomdocdir has to point to the directory containing the jtom documentation
	(usually, the root of the cvs module jtom-doc). If you don't mind producing
	complete distribution sets for tom, you can simply set tomdocdir="stable".
	
Build
-----
	To compile tom, you have to use the build.sh script.
	$ ./build.sh all
	will compile tom stable, then compile tom src, run acceptance tests, produce
	distributions sets for both stable and src. It then compiles examples with
	stable and source, with and without optimizations, and tests some examples.
	(this may take some time)

	You can choose to only build the stable distribution, or the source
	distribution.
	$ ./build.sh -projecthelp
	will list all the available targets for the build.

Setup
-----
Before you can run Tom there is some additional set up you will need
to do:
  - Add the stable/dist/bin and src/dist/bin directories to your path.
		They contains the tom and tom.src scripts, to use tom.
	- Set the TOM_HOME environment variable to either the stable/dist directory
	  orthe src/dist directory. Using stable/dist is the safest option. If you
		use src/dist, the tom command will be equivalent to the tom.src command,
		and the souce version will always be used. (this is optional. If you do not
		set TOM_HOME, stable/dist will be the default).
  - Optionally, set the JAVA_HOME environment variable. 
    This should be set to the directory where your JDK is installed. 
	- To run the examples, we also suggest you to define a TOM_LIB variable and
	  update your CLASSPATH:
(bash)
  TOM_LIB=`echo ${TOM_HOME}/lib/*.jar | tr ' ' ':'`
  export CLASSPATH=${TOM_LIB}:${CLASSPATH}

(csh)
  set TOM_LIB=`echo ${TOM_HOME}/lib/*.jar | tr ' ' ':'`
  setenv CLASSPATH ${TOM_LIB}:${CLASSPATH}
