Installing TOM
==============

The binary distribution of Tom consists of the following directory layout:

  jtom
   +--- bin  // contains launcher scripts
   |
   +--- doc  // contains documentation
   |
   +--- lib  // contains Tom jars plus necessary dependencies
   |
   +--- share
         +--- jtom    // contains predefined mapping
               +--- c
               |
               +--- caml

 Only the bin/ and lib/ directories are required to run Tom.
 To install Tom, choose a directory and copy the distribution file there. 
 This directory will be known as TOM_HOME.

Setup
=====
Before you can run Tom there is some additional set up you will need
to do:
  - Add the bin directory to your path.
  - Set the TOM_HOME environment variable to the directory where you
    installed Tom.

Windows
-------
Assume Tom is installed in c:\jtom\. The following sets up the
environment:
  set TOM_HOME=c:\jtom
  set PATH=%PATH%;%TOM_HOME%\bin

Unix
----
Assume Tom is installed in /usr/local/jtom. The following sets up the
environment:

(bash)
  export TOM_HOME=/usr/local/jtom
  export PATH=${PATH}:${TOM_HOME}/bin

(csh)
  setenv TOM_HOME /usr/local/jtom
  set path=( $path $TOM_HOME/bin )

We also suggest you to define a TOM_LIB variable and update your CLASSPATH:

(bash)
  TOM_LIB=`echo ${TOM_HOME}/lib/*.jar | tr ' ' ':'`
  export TOM_HOME=/usr/local/jtom
  export CLASSPATH=${TOM_LIB}:${CLASSPATH}

(csh)
  set TOM_LIB=`echo ${TOM_HOME}/lib/*.jar | tr ' ' ':'`
  setenv CLASSPATH $TOM_LIB:$CLASSPATH
