Installing Tom
==============

The source distribution of Tom consists of the following directory layout:

  jtom
   +--- stable   // contains the stable version
   |
   +--- src      // contains the development branch
   |
   +--- examples // contains examples of Tom use
   |
   +--- application // contains main applications written in Tom
   |
   +--- test     // the test set (used by junit)

Prepare for the build
---------------------
  The Tom build process uses ant (http://ant.apache.org). This build process is
  specified by the build.xml file. You will need to install apache ant and java
  1.4 in order to compile Tom.

  Next step is to copy the local.properties_template file, found at the root of
  jtom to local.properties, and edit it to reflect your setup:
    tomdocdir has to point to the directory containing the jtom documentation
  (usually, the root of the cvs module jtom-doc). If you don't mind producing
  complete distribution sets for Tom, you can simply set tomdocdir="stable".

Build
-----
  To compile the stable distribution of Tom, you have to use the build.sh script.
  $ ./build.sh stable

	To build and install the source distribution, you have to do the following:
	$ ./build.sh stable
	$ ./build.sh src.dist

  To list all the available targets for the build:
  $ ./build.sh -projecthelp

Setup
-----
Before you can run Tom there is some additional set up you will need
to do:
  - Add the stable/dist/bin and src/dist/bin directories to your path.
    They contains the Tom and Tom.src scripts, to use Tom.
  - Set the TOM_HOME environment variable to either the stable/dist directory
    or the src/dist directory. Using stable/dist is the safest option. If you
    use src/dist, the Tom command will be equivalent to the Tom.src command,
		and the souce version will always be used. (If you do not set TOM_HOME,
		stable/dist will be the default).
  - Optionally, set the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
    This should be set to the directory where your JDK is installed.
  - To run the examples, we also suggest you to define a TOM_LIB variable
    and update your CLASSPATH:
(bash)
  TOM_LIB=`echo ${TOM_HOME}/lib/*.jar | tr ' ' ':'`
  export CLASSPATH=${TOM_LIB}:${CLASSPATH}

(csh)
  set TOM_LIB=`echo ${TOM_HOME}/lib/*.jar | tr ' ' ':'`
  setenv CLASSPATH ${TOM_LIB}:${CLASSPATH}
