%transformation

- extend possible patterns: the same as in strategies

- Tom-EMF: %op implement subconstruct causes problems when generating
  EcorePackage mappings (Entry <-> Map, etc.)

- "delete" with(src args) to(dst args):
  - do not precise args (we will infer them by using %resolve and %tracelink)
  - put ecore files instead: with(MMs.ecore) to(MMt.ecore)
=> done.

- create resolve elements in the TransformerPlugin instead of the Parser
=> done.

- simplify TomSignature
  - use Class() instead of ReferenceClass()? Pb: we need implement and there is
  only extends
  - RuleInstruction? useful?
  - ResolveGetSlotDecl
  - ResolveIsFsymDecl
  - ResolveMakeDecl

- Strategy(): hook system? (test in transformation branch by adding a
  parameter, very easy to use and modify, but it's more a hack) ; new Strategy
  construct allowing to embed code

- short notation for: definition Name traversal `TopDown(WD2PN(args))
  -> args

- resolveInverseLinks: do not generate empty blocks
  - first, authorize empty block generation but without any RuntimeException
  - then, no empty block generation. Possible by making this part more abstract
    and moving it into TransformerPlugin

- transformation strategy: remove resolve strategy
  - remove resolve from transformation strategy
  - add a FunctionCall for resolve strategy
 => why?
 we want to have something like that:

 Strategy transformer = `SimplePDLToPetriNet(translator.tom__linkClass,translator.pn);
 transformer.visit(p_root, new EcoreContainmentIntrospector());
 `TopDown(tom__StratResolve_SimplePDLToPetriNet(translator.tom__linkClass,translator.pn)).visit(translator.pn, new EcoreContainmentIntrospector());

with SimplePDLToPetriNet a Sequence of strategies (elementary transformations).
visit() is applied to the source model, but for resolve strategy, it is applied
to the target model. SimplePDLToPetrinet cannot be one and only one strategy
containing resolve).
