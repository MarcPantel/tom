TODO (last modification: 2014-01-28)

different cases to solve, with potential problems:
- generation of EMF and UML2 libraries vs generation of any other library
- usage of -prefix option or not
- %include{emf/ecore}
- case of builtin types (Tom builtin, EMF ones)
- %oparray generation
- names clashes with EMF and UML libraries => mappings not generated or
  multiple definitions
=> need of a complete review of options management

- mappings generation from .ecore files instead of Java library
- Ada extension. A prototype should have be done, where is it? can it be
  adapted and integrated? At least, can the formalization (matching between
  mappings and EClass, etc.) be retrieved?
- transform "Tom-EMF" to "Tom-Models" by adding:
  - GMS support: EMF-like framework for Ada)
  - KMS support
- call of Tom-EMF directly from Tom, as Tom can call Gom?
- additional output: Gom format?
- Gom2Ecore? (or mappings2Ecore)
