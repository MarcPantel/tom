- should move Intruction generation out of generators ?
- small optimization _* /\ _* -> _*
- another optimization (....,X*,a) -> we shouldn't generate a loop for X*
- remove commented code from propagators
- comment the while generation
- simplify generation !!
- Ref(Variable)
- simplify the propagators because now we do not care if the last element is a var star (we have hooks)
