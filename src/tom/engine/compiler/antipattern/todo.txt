TODO


1. bug when multiple subjects and only one pattern
2. allow disjonctions 
3. guards are not handled
4. in the action we should only allow the free variables - should we provide a warning message ?
5. remove from getTomMappingForConstraint -TomAntiPatternUtils - things that are no more needed
6. clean TomAntiPatternUtils from OrConstraint 
7. rename fresh introduced variables in something like "tom_fresh_var_<no>" to avoid any interference 
that may occur
