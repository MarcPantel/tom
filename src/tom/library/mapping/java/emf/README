Libraries versions:

ecore.tom and uml2.tom have been respectively generated with
emf-generate-mappings from respectively
org.eclipse.emf.ecore_2.5.0.v200906151043.jar and
org.eclipse.uml2.uml_3.2.100.v201108110105.jar libraries (included in lib/tools)


Note to Tom developers:

- When updating the distributed libraries or the mappings, please ensure that
  both are matching. Former mappings should be renamed with the version number
  of the corresponding library, most recent ones should remain ecore.tom and
  uml2.tom.
- uml2.tom contains a StringEList mapping which is strongly related to
  ecore.tom mappings. However, EMF Ecore does need String*, therefore such
  mapping has not been generated, contrary to uml2.tom. For maintainability
  reasons, it could remain as if (no manual operation when updating the
  library). For logical reasons, this part could be moved into ecore.tom or
  into a separated file (e.g. StringEList.tom)


ecore.tom:
- generated from lib/tools/org.eclipse.emf.ecore_2.5.0.v200906151043.jar
- Ecore metamodel is included in the .jar file, under model/ repository
- Ecore metamodel contains 52 EClassifiers
- 56 sorts (%typeterm)
- 28 operators (including 13 variadic ones)

uml2.tom:
- generated from lib/tools/org.eclipse.uml2.uml_3.2.100.v201108110105.jar
- UML2 metamodel is included in the .jar file, under model/ repository
- UML metamodel contains 264 EClassifiers
- 345 sorts (%typeterm)
- 346 operators (including 85 variadic ones)
