Matching1
- an algorithm for solving anti-pattern matching problems
Matching2
- same algorithm, but with the strategy Id instead of fail
Matching3
- modification of the algorithm to allow guards on rules 
Matching4
- another algorithm, a more correct one
Matching5
- same algorithm as 4, but implemented using %rule
- is is not working properly because of the problems with %rule
Problems: 
	- if the construct of terms is in a file, and the rules in another, 
			tom won't apply the rules
	- you cannot control whether a rule should apply or not. For example 
	if you need some rules to apply, and only after they have been applied,
	to run another rule.   	
	- when a strategy applies, the modified term will not fire the rules. 		
			
MatchingDifferences
- another algorithm for anti-pattern matching based on set differences, but it only responds `True or `False,
without giving the substitution when it exists
