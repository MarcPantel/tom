Early tests of Tom C# compiler

You need: 
	a recent mono (free dotnet, mono-project.com) installation
	a recent ikvm (java <-> mono translators) installation

Get it runing:
	make
	./Test.exe


How it works:
	ikvmc converts TOM_HOME/lib/*.jar into one big dotnet dll
	ikvmc converts gom generated java classes into another dll
	Test.t compiles to C# thanks to the new backend

	We still need to substitute some keywords with
	sed on the generated Test.cs:
		- gom does not output C#
		- the 'super' java keyword is 'base' in C#
		  but it is generated in Compiler.t and
		  can not be handled by the C# backend
