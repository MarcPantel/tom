Tom is a language extension which adds pattern matching facilities to
C, Java or Caml. Therefore, Tom is a multi-purpose programming
language.

Depending on your background, Tom can be seen as:
 - a language to perform transformation of XML documents.
 - a preprocessor which helps to perform discrimination over a complex
   data-structure.
 - a tool to manipulate Abstract Syntax Trees.
 - a backend for Rewrite Rule based languages.
 - a powerful Rule based programming language.

* How to start with Tom?
------------------------
If you come from the
 - algebraic programming community
   => start with:
      - addressbook
      - peano
      - gom
      - poly
      - strategy
      - apireach

 - XML community
   => start with
      - dom
      - xml

 - Java programming community
   => start with:
      - builtin
      - peano
      - strings
      - expression (quite complex)

 - C programming community
   => start with:
      - integerc


* Running the examples:
------------------------
  Compilation:
    _To compile all examples, run the script 'build.sh' from directory 'examples',
    assuming Ant is installed. To compile a specific example, specify the example name.
    For instance, to compile example 'peano' only, run 'build.sh peano' (without
    the trailing backslash at the end of peano).

  Execution:
    _To run a specific example, go to directory examples/build/ and execute the java class
    of your choice using your Java Virtual Machine. For instance, to run 'Peano1',
    simply run 'java peano.Peano1'.


* Note about ApiGen/Vas/Gom:
------------------------
  Vas is build on top of ApiGen and both are deprecated. You may now use
  Gom for all your applications (see user manual).

  ApiGen is a system which takes a many-sorted signature as input, and
  generates a concrete implementation for such an abstract data-type.
  In addition, ApiGen/Vas/Gom automatically generate a mapping for Tom.
  This system is useful to manipulate Abstract Syntax Trees since it
  offers an efficient implementation (based on ATerms).
  The implementation supports maximal memory sharing, strong static
  typing as well as parsers and pretty-printers.

  Files' description:
  Matching1
    - an algorithm for solving anti-pattern matching problems
  Matching2
    - same algorithm, but with the strategy Id instead of fail
  Matching3
    - modification of the algorithm to allow guards on rules
  Matching4
    - another algorithm, a more correct one
  Matching5
    - same algorithm as 4, but implemented using %rule
    - is is not working properly because of the problems with %rule
  Problems:
    - if the construct of terms is in a file, and the rules in another,
      tom won't apply the rules
    - you cannot control whether a rule should apply or not. For example
      if you need some rules to apply, and only after they have been applied,
      to run another rule.
    - when a strategy applies, the modified term will not fire the rules.

  MatchingDifferences
    - another algorithm for anti-pattern matching based on set differences, but
      it only responds `True or `False, without giving the substitution when it
      exists
