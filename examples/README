Tom is a language extension which adds pattern matching facilities to
C, Java or Caml. Therefore, Tom is a multi-purpose programming
language. 

Depending on your background, Tom can be seen as:
 - a language to perform transformation of XML documents
 - a preprocessor which helps to describe a discrimination tree over a
   complex data-structure
 - a tool to manipulate Abstract Syntax Trees
 - a backend for Rewrite Rule based languages
 - a first step toward a Rule based programming language

* How to start with Tom?
------------------------
If you come from the 
 - algebraic programming community
   => start with:
      - vas
      - addressbook
      - peano
      - poly
      - apireach

 - XML community
   => start with
      - dom
      - xml

 - Java programming community
   => start with:
      - builtin
      - peano
      - expression (quite complex)

 - C programming community
   => start with:
      - integerc
      - peano
 
* Note about ApiGen:
--------------------
  ApiGen is a system which take a many-sorted signature as input, and
  generates a concrete implementation for such an abstract data-type.
  In addition, ApiGen (adt-to-tom) automatically generates a mapping
  for Tom.
  This system is useful to manipulate Abstract Syntax Trees since it
  offers an efficient implementation (based on ATerms).
  The implementation supports maximal memory sharing, strong static
  typing as well as parsers and pretty-printers.
